# Context

The idea of this application is to simply keep track of students and their grades. 

It is not an ideal project but it can get you to learn the basic CRUD implementation on various assets you would build in your project, which was my goal atleast. 

`nodemiddleware` folder is where our client application resides.  
`chaincode` folder is where our application's chaincode resides.
